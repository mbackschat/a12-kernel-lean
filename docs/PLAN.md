# Active implementation plan

This is the resumption checkpoint, not a work log. Detailed coverage belongs in [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md), open semantic obligations in [`SEMANTICS-GAPS.md`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md), durable conclusions in [`LEAN-FINDINGS.md`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md), and completed work in Git plus the [July 2026 work log](archived/SEMANTIC-WORK-LOG-2026-07.md).

**Priority invariant:** eventual 100% semantic conformance with kernel 30.8.1 remains the primary goal, with consumer adequacy as the co-equal representation test.

## Verified baseline

**Last full gate, 2026-07-27:** `lake build` 545 jobs · trust audit **1481 theorem roots; 31453 declarations in 301 modules** · `lake test` 51/51. Re-run the applicable tier commands in [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md#tier-gates) before relying on these changing counts.

- SG1 is closed at one immutable model-certified `CheckedDocument`; processing context remains separate.
- SG2 is closed. Canonical topology, complete named `Env`, checked addressed reads, hierarchical omitted tails, exact stored payload, filter/relevance provenance, structural failure, and relevance-derived partial group products compose across Number, String, Enumeration, aggregate, value-list, temporal, group-presence, and nested RNU consumers.
- The ordinary repeatable validation loop derives its scope from the checked condition, enumerates actual rows only, reads ancestor/current declarations through the checked document, and emits at exact repeatable error addresses. Current static legality is level-local and preserves `insufficient` for unclassified families.
- Both group-terminal interpretations below stars are closed for full validation. A terminal repeatable group counts structural terminal rows; a nonrepeatable terminal reuses the same checked topology to select complete environments and derives the existing descendant-content/error group product in each. The shared tally, ordinary rule loop, and structural failure channel remain unchanged.
- The six coverage dimensions are executable, proof-closed, Kernel-locked, Kernel-calibrated, public, and consumer-qualified. [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md) owns their clause-level state; absent `Kernel-locked` rows mean not yet assessed, not no evidence.
- The universal Core IL is closed and archived. [`PROJECT-DESIGN.md`](PROJECT-DESIGN.md#representation-policy-for-derived-consumers) owns the live family-data default and the six conditions for reconsidering a checked-plan IR.
- The SG4 dependency-transitive-skip ambiguity is closed in favor of reached-read poison. The static dependency graph constrains generated call order; it does not pre-propagate invalidity through an unread edge. [`LF77`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md#lf77--a-dependency-graph-can-order-every-computation-without-deciding-which-dependency-failures-propagate) owns the durable mechanism.
- The bounded nonrepeatable SG4 source packet is closed. Code generation topologically orders one generated method per target field; each method owns one flattened first-selected table, and a selected operation ends that target-instance scan even when it stores nothing. [`SPEC-2026-07-26-03`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-03--same-target-computations-flatten-into-one-first-selected-table) carries the resulting peer correction and selected-empty String separator.
- The first proof-bearing internal Analyze pilot is closed over the existing checked flat tree. It detects only the exact root-level same-field presence contradiction in either authored order and proves that every returned witness is never firing; it adds no IR, recursive simplifier, solver, command, protocol, or shipment.
- Repeated starred group-list admission remains pending peer reconciliation under [`SPEC-2026-07-23-09`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-23-09--fixed-group-list-predicates-admit-field-and-group-operands), the bound-prefix static rule under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-01`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-01--starred-group-list-iteration-guards-are-operator--and-operand-sensitive), and the nonrepeatable-terminal composition under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-02`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-02--a-nonrepeatable-group-below-starred-ancestors-retains-group-product-semantics).

## Active semantic unit

Open the bounded SG6 dynamic-time packet for `DifferenceInHours`, `DifferenceInMinutes`, and `DifferenceInSeconds`, then close the smallest checked `Now` operand route that retains `World` as an explicit evaluation input without duplicating the existing temporal expression tree.

## Immediate sequence

1. Inventory the existing `Now`, sub-day difference, `World`, checked numeric-source, computation, and generated-validation owners; verify the source-defined evaluation point and legal authoring shapes without reopening already-closed exact-instant arithmetic.
2. Run the dangerous discriminator first: the same checked expression under two `World` values must retain different exact instants, while two Berlin overlap values with one wall label remain distinguishable. Reject any design that captures the clock during checking or stores only wall components.
3. If the existing owners admit a narrow composition, add one explicit-world checked `Now` route through the shared sub-day source and its existing Number computation/generated-validation consumers, with a static rejection or honest gap for every unsupported context. Otherwise stop at the exact missing representation fact rather than adding a temporal-only duplicate AST.

## Parked boundaries

- Eager prepass invalidity needs no second snapshot because `CheckedDocument` already owns computation-phase checked cells. Its supplied messages enter the completed SG4 partition directly; no eager-prepass reconstruction or SG10 rendering belongs in that structural boundary.
- Computation scheduling, state transition, and the computation-result pointer partition remain under [`SG4`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg4--computation-scheduling-and-state-transition); message rendering remains under SG10; Boolean/Confirm configured-token metadata under SG5; future operator-family admission and projections under their owning semantic gaps.
- Public protocol expansion, semantic shipments, dependencies, SMT integration, and new evidence/process machinery require their existing explicit adoption or approval gates.

## Stop and resume

- Stop if a required model fact or separating witness is absent, if an existing owner already closes the candidate, or before introducing a duplicate representation or unapproved infrastructure.
- Keep sibling repositories read-only and visibly unchanged. Never push without an explicit current request.
- On resumption, read the active semantic unit above, then inspect its implementation owner, recent history, cross-project handoffs, and applicable [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) rung before writing a red case.
