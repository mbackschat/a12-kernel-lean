# Active implementation plan

This is the resumption checkpoint, not a work log. Detailed coverage belongs in [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md), open semantic obligations in [`SEMANTICS-GAPS.md`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md), durable conclusions in [`LEAN-FINDINGS.md`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md), and completed work in Git plus the [July 2026 work log](archived/SEMANTIC-WORK-LOG-2026-07.md).

**Priority invariant:** eventual 100% semantic conformance with kernel 30.8.1 remains the primary goal, with consumer adequacy as the co-equal representation test.

## Verified baseline

**Last full gate, 2026-07-26:** `lake build` 475 jobs · trust audit **1342 theorem roots; 27617 declarations in 253 modules** · `lake test` 51/51 · `lake exe checkReferenceProcess` 51/51. Re-run the four commands in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#building--running) before relying on these changing counts.

- SG1 is closed at one immutable model-certified `CheckedDocument`; processing context remains separate.
- SG2 is active. Canonical topology, complete `Env`, checked addressed reads, hierarchical omitted tails, exact stored payload, filter/relevance provenance, and structural failure already compose across multiple Number, String, Enumeration, aggregate, value-list, temporal, group-presence, and one-level RNU consumers. The finite remaining checklist is in [`SG2`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction).
- The ordinary repeatable validation loop derives its scope from the checked condition, enumerates actual rows only, reads ancestor/current declarations through the checked document, and emits at exact repeatable error addresses. Current static legality is level-local and preserves `insufficient` for unclassified families.
- Both group-terminal interpretations below stars are closed for full validation. A terminal repeatable group counts structural terminal rows; a nonrepeatable terminal reuses the same checked topology to select complete environments and derives the existing descendant-content/error group product in each. The shared tally, ordinary rule loop, and structural failure channel remain unchanged.
- The six coverage dimensions are executable, proof-closed, Kernel-locked, Kernel-calibrated, public, and consumer-qualified. [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md) owns their clause-level state; absent `Kernel-locked` rows mean not yet assessed, not no evidence.
- The universal Core IL is closed and archived. [`PROJECT-DESIGN.md`](PROJECT-DESIGN.md#representation-policy-for-derived-consumers) owns the live family-data default and the six conditions for reconsidering a checked-plan IR.
- The SG4 dependency-transitive-skip ambiguity is closed in favor of reached-read poison. The static dependency graph constrains generated call order; it does not pre-propagate invalidity through an unread edge. [`LF77`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md#lf77--a-dependency-graph-can-order-every-computation-without-deciding-which-dependency-failures-propagate) owns the durable mechanism.
- The first proof-bearing internal Analyze pilot is closed over the existing checked flat tree. It detects only the exact root-level same-field presence contradiction in either authored order and proves that every returned witness is never firing; it adds no IR, recursive simplifier, solver, command, protocol, or shipment.
- Repeated starred group-list admission remains pending peer reconciliation under [`SPEC-2026-07-23-09`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-23-09--fixed-group-list-predicates-admit-field-and-group-operands), the bound-prefix static rule under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-01`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-01--starred-group-list-iteration-guards-are-operator--and-operand-sensitive), and the nonrepeatable-terminal composition under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-02`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-02--a-nonrepeatable-group-below-starred-ancestors-retains-group-product-semantics).

## Latest semantic milestone

Checked nonrepeatable partial rules now compose the existing three-stage contract instead of stopping at a low-level flat evaluator. The route derives the complete-tree filter marker, augments wildcardable relevance with model-owned global fields, gates on the explicit error field, maps only out-of-set leaf reads to UNKNOWN, bypasses the full content gate for admitted empty instances, and reuses the sole message emitter. Cases separate global from non-global admission, rule skip from evaluated UNKNOWN, decisive `Or` from suppressed `And`, and partial empty-as-zero from full-validation content suppression.

## Active semantic unit

Continue [`SG2` whole-rule partial validation](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction) with one-level repeatable row admission. Determine how caller relevance adds actual and phantom error-field environments, then reuse the checked document and addressed condition route without turning a missing physical row into topology or a rule-level skip into UNKNOWN.

## Immediate sequence

1. Audit kernel and maintained a12-dmkits partial iteration for the exact union and order of physical actual rows and relevant phantom error-field instances at one repeatable level.
2. Write red whole-rule cases separating an irrelevant actual row, a relevant actual row, a relevant phantom row, and a relevant error row with one nonrelevant condition peer.
3. Extend the ordinary checked rule loop only at its environment-selection seam, preserve structural checked reads for physical rows and the source-grounded phantom observation rule, then prove that rule admission remains outside semantic UNKNOWN.

## Parked boundaries

- Computation scheduling and state transition remain under [`SG4`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg4--computation-scheduling-and-state-transition); messages under SG10; Boolean/Confirm configured-token metadata under SG5; future operator-family admission and projections under their owning semantic gaps.
- Public protocol expansion, semantic shipments, dependencies, SMT integration, and new evidence/process machinery require their existing explicit adoption or approval gates.

## Stop and resume

- Stop if a required model fact or separating witness is absent, if an existing owner already closes the candidate, or before introducing a duplicate representation or unapproved infrastructure.
- Keep sibling repositories read-only and visibly unchanged. Never push without an explicit current request.
- On resumption, read the active semantic unit above, then inspect its implementation owner, recent history, cross-project handoffs, and applicable [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) rung before writing a red case.
