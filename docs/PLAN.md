# Active implementation plan

This is the resumption checkpoint, not a work log. Detailed coverage belongs in [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md), open semantic obligations in [`SEMANTICS-GAPS.md`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md), durable conclusions in [`LEAN-FINDINGS.md`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md), and completed work in Git plus the [July 2026 work log](archived/SEMANTIC-WORK-LOG-2026-07.md).

**Priority invariant:** eventual 100% semantic conformance with kernel 30.8.1 remains the primary goal, with consumer adequacy as the co-equal representation test.

## Verified baseline

**Last full gate, 2026-07-30:** `lake build` 660 jobs · trust audit **1735 theorem roots; 39972 declarations in 378 modules** · `lake test` 51/51. Re-run the applicable tier commands in [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md#tier-gates) before relying on these changing counts.

- SG1 is closed at one immutable model-certified `CheckedDocument`; processing context remains separate.
- SG2 is closed. Canonical topology, complete named `Env`, checked addressed reads, hierarchical omitted tails, exact stored payload, filter/relevance provenance, structural failure, and relevance-derived partial group products compose across Number, String, Enumeration, aggregate, value-list, temporal, group-presence, and nested RNU consumers.
- The ordinary repeatable validation loop derives its scope from the checked condition, enumerates actual rows only, reads ancestor/current declarations through the checked document, and emits at exact repeatable error addresses. Current static legality is level-local and preserves `insufficient` for unclassified families.
- Both group-terminal interpretations below stars are closed for full validation. A terminal repeatable group counts structural terminal rows; a nonrepeatable terminal reuses the same checked topology to select complete environments and derives the existing descendant-content/error group product in each. The shared tally, ordinary rule loop, and structural failure channel remain unchanged.
- The six coverage dimensions are executable, proof-closed, Kernel-locked, Kernel-calibrated, public, and consumer-qualified. [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md) owns their clause-level state; absent `Kernel-locked` rows mean not yet assessed, not no evidence.
- The universal Core IL is closed and archived. [`PROJECT-DESIGN.md`](PROJECT-DESIGN.md#representation-policy-for-derived-consumers) owns the live family-data default and the six conditions for reconsidering a checked-plan IR.
- The SG4 dependency-transitive-skip ambiguity is closed in favor of reached-read poison. The static dependency graph constrains generated call order; it does not pre-propagate invalidity through an unread edge. [`LF77`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md#lf77--a-dependency-graph-can-order-every-computation-without-deciding-which-dependency-failures-propagate) owns the durable mechanism.
- The bounded nonrepeatable SG4 source packet is closed. Code generation topologically orders one generated method per target field; each method owns one flattened first-selected table, and a selected operation ends that target-instance scan even when it stores nothing. [`SPEC-2026-07-26-03`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-03--same-target-computations-flatten-into-one-first-selected-table) carries the resulting peer correction and selected-empty String separator.
- The checked SG10 authoring boundary now retains two producer-specific grammars over one one-pass renderer. The bounded rule fragment admits `$$`, `$Field$`, and `$Field.value$` with one bare referenced nonrepeatable field. The measured `en_US` String-pattern field fragment admits only fixed lowercase `$field$`/`$field.value$`, rejects `$$`, lowers already-selected owning-field bytes directly, and preserves the established pattern failure; a12-dmkits `ed0b0cd9f7110daa354c2404e7b9ca6df4f42fa3` locks both kernel strategies and the distinct requiredness control. Wider rule paths, locales, provider invocation, requiredness grammar, and other field producers remain explicit insufficiency. a12-dmkits still needs the isolated rule-renderer literal-dollar correction recorded under SG10, but that does not block local semantics.
- The first proof-bearing internal Analyze pilot is closed over the existing checked flat tree. It detects only the exact root-level same-field presence contradiction in either authored order and proves that every returned witness is never firing; it adds no IR, recursive simplifier, solver, command, protocol, or shipment.
- Repeated starred group-list admission and its zero-row polarity are reconciled under [`SPEC-2026-07-23-09`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-23-09--fixed-group-list-predicates-admit-field-and-group-operands). The bound-prefix static rule under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-01`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-01--starred-group-list-iteration-guards-are-operator--and-operand-sensitive) is accepted at a12-dmkits `b9ade32d300c2d10bb70ac7dc18daf7a6779a9ec`, and the nonrepeatable-terminal composition under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-02`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-02--a-nonrepeatable-group-below-starred-ancestors-retains-group-product-semantics) is accepted at `8cab6ece3a0b355e1a831792fa14b0b711548755`.

## Active semantic unit

Admit multiple supplied nonrepeatable String computations targeting the same field by flattening their alternatives into the existing per-target first-selected table. Accepted [`SPEC-2026-07-26-03`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-03--same-target-computations-flatten-into-one-first-selected-table) supplies the representation-defining separator: an unguarded selected empty String operation ends the table and clears the target, while a false guard remains unselected and allows a later computation to win. Reuse the existing checked String table, source-relative result, application, and scheduling owners; introduce no computation-boundary selector or generic graph.

## Immediate sequence

1. Inventory current authored String computation, table, run, result, and application owners plus the exact single-target restriction. Confirm that multiplicity changes only authoring/lowering and does not duplicate the existing selector or scheduler.
2. Red-first, supply two computations for one String target. Separate an unguarded selected-empty first operation from a false-guard first operation, with a selected-value control and exact source-relative cleared/changed application outcomes.
3. Flatten supplied alternatives in encounter order into the existing checked target table. Preserve each computation's common guard at its alternatives and keep selection distinct from storage.
4. Prove the flattened table preserves encounter order and that a selected empty result terminates while an unselected prefix does not. Exercise the Execute/Analyze query through the existing run/result/application API and keep repeatable targets, cross-family schedules, and public collection order excluded.

## Parked boundaries

- Eager prepass invalidity needs no second snapshot because `CheckedDocument` already owns computation-phase checked cells. Its supplied messages enter the completed SG4 partition directly; no eager-prepass reconstruction or SG10 rendering belongs in that structural boundary.
- Computation scheduling, state transition, and the computation-result pointer partition remain under [`SG4`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg4--computation-scheduling-and-state-transition); message rendering remains under SG10; future operator-family admission and projections remain under their owning semantic gaps.
- The a12-dmkits rule-template `$$` renderer correction is an isolated upstream implementation/test request against an already-correct canonical rule clause. The accepted field-owned experiment proves that String-pattern `$$` rejection and requiredness preservation are distinct behavior, not substitutes for that rule fix.
- Field-owned message locales beyond the measured `en_US` String-pattern producer, complete requiredness grammar, provider invocation, empty-value fallback, and other producer channels remain under SG10; they do not block SG4 computation work.
- Public protocol expansion, semantic shipments, dependencies, SMT integration, and new evidence/process machinery require their existing explicit adoption or approval gates.

## Stop and resume

- Stop if a required model fact or separating witness is absent, if an existing owner already closes the candidate, or before introducing a duplicate representation or unapproved infrastructure.
- Keep sibling repositories read-only and visibly unchanged. Never push without an explicit current request.
- On resumption, read the active semantic unit above, then inspect its implementation owner, recent history, cross-project handoffs, and applicable [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) rung before writing a red case.
