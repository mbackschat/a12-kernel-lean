# Active implementation plan

This is the resumption checkpoint, not a work log. Detailed coverage belongs in [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md), open semantic obligations in [`SEMANTICS-GAPS.md`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md), durable conclusions in [`LEAN-FINDINGS.md`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md), and completed work in Git plus the [July 2026 work log](archived/SEMANTIC-WORK-LOG-2026-07.md).

**Priority invariant:** eventual 100% semantic conformance with kernel 30.8.1 remains the primary goal, with consumer adequacy as the co-equal representation test.

## Verified baseline

**Last full gate, 2026-07-26:** `lake build` 483 jobs · trust audit **1365 theorem roots; 28602 declarations in 257 modules** · `lake test` 51/51. The unchanged public reference process last passed 51/51 at the preceding baseline. Re-run the applicable tier commands in [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md#tier-gates) before relying on these changing counts.

- SG1 is closed at one immutable model-certified `CheckedDocument`; processing context remains separate.
- SG2 is active. Canonical topology, complete `Env`, checked addressed reads, hierarchical omitted tails, exact stored payload, filter/relevance provenance, and structural failure already compose across multiple Number, String, Enumeration, aggregate, value-list, temporal, group-presence, and nested RNU consumers. The finite remaining checklist is in [`SG2`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction).
- The ordinary repeatable validation loop derives its scope from the checked condition, enumerates actual rows only, reads ancestor/current declarations through the checked document, and emits at exact repeatable error addresses. Current static legality is level-local and preserves `insufficient` for unclassified families.
- Both group-terminal interpretations below stars are closed for full validation. A terminal repeatable group counts structural terminal rows; a nonrepeatable terminal reuses the same checked topology to select complete environments and derives the existing descendant-content/error group product in each. The shared tally, ordinary rule loop, and structural failure channel remain unchanged.
- The six coverage dimensions are executable, proof-closed, Kernel-locked, Kernel-calibrated, public, and consumer-qualified. [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md) owns their clause-level state; absent `Kernel-locked` rows mean not yet assessed, not no evidence.
- The universal Core IL is closed and archived. [`PROJECT-DESIGN.md`](PROJECT-DESIGN.md#representation-policy-for-derived-consumers) owns the live family-data default and the six conditions for reconsidering a checked-plan IR.
- The SG4 dependency-transitive-skip ambiguity is closed in favor of reached-read poison. The static dependency graph constrains generated call order; it does not pre-propagate invalidity through an unread edge. [`LF77`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md#lf77--a-dependency-graph-can-order-every-computation-without-deciding-which-dependency-failures-propagate) owns the durable mechanism.
- The first proof-bearing internal Analyze pilot is closed over the existing checked flat tree. It detects only the exact root-level same-field presence contradiction in either authored order and proves that every returned witness is never firing; it adds no IR, recursive simplifier, solver, command, protocol, or shipment.
- Repeated starred group-list admission remains pending peer reconciliation under [`SPEC-2026-07-23-09`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-23-09--fixed-group-list-predicates-admit-field-and-group-operands), the bound-prefix static rule under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-01`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-01--starred-group-list-iteration-guards-are-operator--and-operand-sensitive), and the nonrepeatable-terminal composition under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-02`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-02--a-nonrepeatable-group-below-starred-ancestors-retains-group-product-semantics).

## Latest semantic milestone

Successful canonical star resolution now carries a proved inductive correspondence between its hierarchical row tree and its ordered complete environments. Every reopened coordinate extends the exact bound outer prefix at the named axis, and each sibling contributes its leaf environments before the remaining siblings. The guarantee is scoped to successful checked resolution; an arbitrary caller-constructed topology need not satisfy it.

## Active semantic unit

Run the trigger-required bounded cold consumer milestone for [`SG2`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction) against the existing public checked representations. Test whether an artifact-only Execute/Analyze implementer can discover the canonical checked document, named environment/topology relation, addressed operand construction, filter/relevance provenance, and structural failure boundary without kernel or sibling-project research. Reconcile only concrete discoverability or adequacy defects. The separately blocked partial group-product route remains outside until the ordinary partial rule context carries the relevance-selected preliminary slice already owned by `CheckedPartialPreliminary`.

## Immediate sequence

1. Prepare the bounded allowlist from the project-local task contract, checked-document/addressing owners, laws, separating cases, implementation map, and consumer guidance; exclude the kernel, a12-dmkits, Git history, prior discussion, and unlisted files.
2. Have the cold reader reconstruct the Execute/Analyze decision path and report only concrete discoverability, hidden-assumption, or adequacy defects.
3. Reconcile any concrete finding at its existing semantic or documentation owner. A clean review creates no report or permanent probe source.

## Parked boundaries

- Computation scheduling and state transition remain under [`SG4`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg4--computation-scheduling-and-state-transition); messages under SG10; Boolean/Confirm configured-token metadata under SG5; future operator-family admission and projections under their owning semantic gaps.
- Public protocol expansion, semantic shipments, dependencies, SMT integration, and new evidence/process machinery require their existing explicit adoption or approval gates.

## Stop and resume

- Stop if a required model fact or separating witness is absent, if an existing owner already closes the candidate, or before introducing a duplicate representation or unapproved infrastructure.
- Keep sibling repositories read-only and visibly unchanged. Never push without an explicit current request.
- On resumption, read the active semantic unit above, then inspect its implementation owner, recent history, cross-project handoffs, and applicable [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) rung before writing a red case.
