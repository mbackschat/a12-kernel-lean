# Active implementation plan

This is the resumption checkpoint, not a work log. Detailed coverage belongs in [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md), open semantic obligations in [`SEMANTICS-GAPS.md`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md), durable conclusions in [`LEAN-FINDINGS.md`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md), and completed work in Git plus the [July 2026 work log](archived/SEMANTIC-WORK-LOG-2026-07.md).

**Priority invariant:** eventual 100% semantic conformance with kernel 30.8.1 remains the primary goal, with consumer adequacy as the co-equal representation test.

## Verified baseline

**Last full gate, 2026-07-26:** `lake build` 483 jobs · trust audit **1362 theorem roots; 28424 declarations in 257 modules** · `lake test` 51/51. The unchanged public reference process last passed 51/51 at the preceding baseline. Re-run the applicable tier commands in [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md#tier-gates) before relying on these changing counts.

- SG1 is closed at one immutable model-certified `CheckedDocument`; processing context remains separate.
- SG2 is active. Canonical topology, complete `Env`, checked addressed reads, hierarchical omitted tails, exact stored payload, filter/relevance provenance, and structural failure already compose across multiple Number, String, Enumeration, aggregate, value-list, temporal, group-presence, and nested RNU consumers. The finite remaining checklist is in [`SG2`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction).
- The ordinary repeatable validation loop derives its scope from the checked condition, enumerates actual rows only, reads ancestor/current declarations through the checked document, and emits at exact repeatable error addresses. Current static legality is level-local and preserves `insufficient` for unclassified families.
- Both group-terminal interpretations below stars are closed for full validation. A terminal repeatable group counts structural terminal rows; a nonrepeatable terminal reuses the same checked topology to select complete environments and derives the existing descendant-content/error group product in each. The shared tally, ordinary rule loop, and structural failure channel remain unchanged.
- The six coverage dimensions are executable, proof-closed, Kernel-locked, Kernel-calibrated, public, and consumer-qualified. [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md) owns their clause-level state; absent `Kernel-locked` rows mean not yet assessed, not no evidence.
- The universal Core IL is closed and archived. [`PROJECT-DESIGN.md`](PROJECT-DESIGN.md#representation-policy-for-derived-consumers) owns the live family-data default and the six conditions for reconsidering a checked-plan IR.
- The SG4 dependency-transitive-skip ambiguity is closed in favor of reached-read poison. The static dependency graph constrains generated call order; it does not pre-propagate invalidity through an unread edge. [`LF77`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md#lf77--a-dependency-graph-can-order-every-computation-without-deciding-which-dependency-failures-propagate) owns the durable mechanism.
- The first proof-bearing internal Analyze pilot is closed over the existing checked flat tree. It detects only the exact root-level same-field presence contradiction in either authored order and proves that every returned witness is never firing; it adds no IR, recursive simplifier, solver, command, protocol, or shipment.
- Repeated starred group-list admission remains pending peer reconciliation under [`SPEC-2026-07-23-09`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-23-09--fixed-group-list-predicates-admit-field-and-group-operands), the bound-prefix static rule under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-01`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-01--starred-group-list-iteration-guards-are-operator--and-operand-sensitive), and the nonrepeatable-terminal composition under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-02`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-02--a-nonrepeatable-group-below-starred-ancestors-retains-group-product-semantics).

## Latest semantic milestone

The exact-text parallel join and its positive two-field full-validation consumer now admit symmetric and asymmetric nonrepeatable wrappers before either keyed group and below either operand. The checked pair derives the exact common group ancestor, requires equal outer repeatable scopes, and proves that ancestor prefixes both group paths. Each operand resolves its sole indexed ancestor and must add no deeper repeatable binding. Lexical union order, clean versus invalid unmatched reads, matched invalid-column reads, and exact physical error addresses are unchanged; a repeatable intermediate still fails closed as the distinct framed shape. The generated-preliminary column remains shared with Number semantic index; Number parallel ordering, the one-sided repeatable frame, synthetic-pointer messages, and exact Kernel duplicate-winner correspondence remain outside this profile.

## Active semantic unit

Continue [`SG2` semantic-index/parallel construction](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction) with the source-closed one-sided repeatable frame: one joined keyed group may sit below one or more non-indexed repeatable ancestors while the other remains shared at their common outer scope. Reuse the checked group pair, generated-preliminary columns, optional side observations, positive condition tree, and emitter, but enumerate actual frame environments outside the existing per-environment join. Do not admit multiple framed sides, Number ordering, negative operators, partial validation, computation clearing, peer-pointer messages, a general parallel plan, or an externally exact duplicate-winner claim in that capsule. The group-product audit remains separately blocked because the ordinary partial rule context does not carry the relevance-selected preliminary slice.

## Immediate sequence

1. Extract the exact frame environments from existing instantiated rows using the frame's complete repeatable scope; exclude over-limit frame rows and preserve document order.
2. Add red whole-rule cases with two frame rows, a shared unframed side, per-frame matched/unmatched keys, one invalid framed column, exact nested error addresses, and a second-framed-side refusal.
3. Run the unchanged checked join once per frame environment, concatenate keyed outcomes in frame order, and retain enough environment metadata for Execute/Explain without adding a topology, document view, path AST, or general parallel evaluator.

## Parked boundaries

- Computation scheduling and state transition remain under [`SG4`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg4--computation-scheduling-and-state-transition); messages under SG10; Boolean/Confirm configured-token metadata under SG5; future operator-family admission and projections under their owning semantic gaps.
- Public protocol expansion, semantic shipments, dependencies, SMT integration, and new evidence/process machinery require their existing explicit adoption or approval gates.

## Stop and resume

- Stop if a required model fact or separating witness is absent, if an existing owner already closes the candidate, or before introducing a duplicate representation or unapproved infrastructure.
- Keep sibling repositories read-only and visibly unchanged. Never push without an explicit current request.
- On resumption, read the active semantic unit above, then inspect its implementation owner, recent history, cross-project handoffs, and applicable [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) rung before writing a red case.
