# Active implementation plan

This is the resumption checkpoint, not a work log. Detailed coverage belongs in [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md), open semantic obligations in [`SEMANTICS-GAPS.md`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md), durable conclusions in [`LEAN-FINDINGS.md`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md), and completed work in Git plus the [July 2026 work log](archived/SEMANTIC-WORK-LOG-2026-07.md).

**Priority invariant:** eventual 100% semantic conformance with kernel 30.8.1 remains the primary goal, with consumer adequacy as the co-equal representation test.

## Verified baseline

**Last full gate, 2026-07-26:** `lake build` 483 jobs · trust audit **1365 theorem roots; 28565 declarations in 257 modules** · `lake test` 51/51. The unchanged public reference process last passed 51/51 at the preceding baseline. Re-run the applicable tier commands in [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md#tier-gates) before relying on these changing counts.

- SG1 is closed at one immutable model-certified `CheckedDocument`; processing context remains separate.
- SG2 is active. Canonical topology, complete `Env`, checked addressed reads, hierarchical omitted tails, exact stored payload, filter/relevance provenance, and structural failure already compose across multiple Number, String, Enumeration, aggregate, value-list, temporal, group-presence, and nested RNU consumers. The finite remaining checklist is in [`SG2`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction).
- The ordinary repeatable validation loop derives its scope from the checked condition, enumerates actual rows only, reads ancestor/current declarations through the checked document, and emits at exact repeatable error addresses. Current static legality is level-local and preserves `insufficient` for unclassified families.
- Both group-terminal interpretations below stars are closed for full validation. A terminal repeatable group counts structural terminal rows; a nonrepeatable terminal reuses the same checked topology to select complete environments and derives the existing descendant-content/error group product in each. The shared tally, ordinary rule loop, and structural failure channel remain unchanged.
- The six coverage dimensions are executable, proof-closed, Kernel-locked, Kernel-calibrated, public, and consumer-qualified. [`IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md) owns their clause-level state; absent `Kernel-locked` rows mean not yet assessed, not no evidence.
- The universal Core IL is closed and archived. [`PROJECT-DESIGN.md`](PROJECT-DESIGN.md#representation-policy-for-derived-consumers) owns the live family-data default and the six conditions for reconsidering a checked-plan IR.
- The SG4 dependency-transitive-skip ambiguity is closed in favor of reached-read poison. The static dependency graph constrains generated call order; it does not pre-propagate invalidity through an unread edge. [`LF77`](LEAN-FINDINGS.md#lf77--a-dependency-graph-can-order-every-computation-without-deciding-which-dependency-failures-propagate) owns the durable mechanism.
- The first proof-bearing internal Analyze pilot is closed over the existing checked flat tree. It detects only the exact root-level same-field presence contradiction in either authored order and proves that every returned witness is never firing; it adds no IR, recursive simplifier, solver, command, protocol, or shipment.
- Repeated starred group-list admission remains pending peer reconciliation under [`SPEC-2026-07-23-09`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-23-09--fixed-group-list-predicates-admit-field-and-group-operands), the bound-prefix static rule under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-01`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-01--starred-group-list-iteration-guards-are-operator--and-operand-sensitive), and the nonrepeatable-terminal composition under [`SPEC-2026-07-26-02`](A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md#spec-2026-07-26-02--a-nonrepeatable-group-below-starred-ancestors-retains-group-product-semantics).

## Latest semantic milestone

The exact-text parallel join and its positive two-field full-validation consumer now admit a non-indexed repeatable frame on the emitted error side as well as symmetric/asymmetric nonrepeatable wrappers. The checked pair classifies equal outer scopes or one strict frame suffix and rejects divergent frames on both sides. Framed execution enumerates actual deepest frame rows in document order, excludes over-limit rows, recalculates the unchanged lexical join inside each frame, and leaves the opposite column at the common outer environment. Per-frame invalidity, exact nested error addresses, both operand orders, framed-side error ownership, and complete outer-environment result metadata are locked. The generated-preliminary column remains shared with Number semantic index; Number parallel ordering, synthetic-pointer messages, wider operators, partial validation, and exact Kernel duplicate-winner correspondence remain with their separate owners.

## Active semantic unit

Continue [`SG2` correspondence closure](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg2--general-repeatable-addressing-and-operand-construction) by identifying the checklist's one remaining generic tree/environment theorem in the existing checked construction and proving it at its narrow semantic owner. The theorem must connect a complete named `Env` and the canonical hierarchical construction without restating a family wrapper or inventing another stream. After that proof lands, run the trigger-required bounded cold consumer milestone against the existing public checked representations and reconcile only concrete discoverability or adequacy defects. The separately blocked partial group-product route remains outside until the ordinary partial rule context carries the relevance-selected preliminary slice already owned by `CheckedPartialPreliminary`.

## Immediate sequence

1. Inventory the generic environment/topology laws, SG2 same-context queries, and open proof-spine claims to name the exact missing theorem and reject any already-proved restatement.
2. Add the smallest discriminating theorem statement and its nearest executable non-law/control at the existing owner; prove it without a new representation, adapter, or recursive evaluator.
3. Run the proportional gates and commit that proof capsule, then perform the artifact-only SG2 consumer review required by the reusable capability milestone. A review result with no concrete defect creates no report or permanent probe source.

## Parked boundaries

- Computation scheduling and state transition remain under [`SG4`](SEMANTICS-GAPS.md#sg4--computation-scheduling-and-state-transition); messages under SG10; Boolean/Confirm configured-token metadata under SG5; future operator-family admission and projections under their owning semantic gaps.
- Public protocol expansion, semantic shipments, dependencies, SMT integration, and new evidence/process machinery require their existing explicit adoption or approval gates.

## Stop and resume

- Stop if a required model fact or separating witness is absent, if an existing owner already closes the candidate, or before introducing a duplicate representation or unapproved infrastructure.
- Keep sibling repositories read-only and visibly unchanged. Never push without an explicit current request.
- On resumption, read the active semantic unit above, then inspect its implementation owner, recent history, cross-project handoffs, and applicable [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) rung before writing a red case.
