# a12-dmkits specification synchronization ledger

This is the live outbound reconciliation queue for changes to the project-owned language-neutral semantics under [`../spec/`](../spec/). It owns current `SPEC-` corrections and `EXP-` observation requests without becoming a second semantic specification. The 164 terminal receipts through 2026-08-28 are preserved with their stable anchors in the [historical ledger](archived/A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER-THROUGH-2026-08-28.md).

## Ledger contract

Every commit that corrects, narrows, or extends kernel behavior in `spec/` and still needs a12-dmkits reconciliation must add or update an entry here in the same change. The spec clause owns the complete semantic account; an entry links to that clause and records only the transport facts needed by a12-dmkits.

An inbound correction whose exact source revision is already committed and reviewed in a12-dmkits does not create a new outbound entry. Record that revision and its evidence route in [`SOURCES.md`](SOURCES.md). If the inbound result answers an existing `pending` or `handed-off` entry, update that same entry instead.

Pure spelling, formatting, link, and non-semantic navigation edits do not enter the ledger. One entry may group several clauses only when they express one coherent behavioral correction with one upstream acceptance decision.

Each entry has a stable `SPEC-YYYY-MM-DD-NN` or `EXP-YYYY-MM-DD-NN` ID that is unique across both this file and the [historical ledger](archived/A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER-THROUGH-2026-08-28.md). IDs are never reused. An entry records its exact status, canonical clause or experiment question, concise delta, evidence basis and kernel version, expected reconciliation surfaces, acceptance condition, local introducing revision, and reviewed a12-dmkits revision and disposition when terminal. A later correction creates a new entry with `Supersedes`; it never rewrites a terminal receipt.

Statuses are exactly `pending`, `handed-off`, `accepted`, `resolved`, `rejected`, or `superseded`. `accepted` requires review of an exact a12-dmkits revision against the entry's acceptance condition. `resolved` is only for an `EXP-` closed locally without an upstream observation. An inconclusive handback remains `handed-off`. Contrary kernel evidence prevents acceptance and requires the local semantic account to be corrected before the entry is rejected or superseded.

The user transfers pending entries. Treat the entire `../a12-rulekit/` checkout as read-only. Reconciliation here means inspecting an exact committed a12-dmkits revision and recording the reviewed outcome in the existing entry. Do not create a second feedback ledger. A `dmtool-release` instrument defect belongs in a dated feedback note under the user's exchange directory, as defined by [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md#structured-dmtool-probes-and-feedback), not in this ledger.

The introducing revision cannot name itself inside the same commit. Until handoff, `introducing commit` means the first commit containing the stable entry ID; resolve it with:

```sh
git log --reverse -S 'SPEC-YYYY-MM-DD-NN' --format='%H' -- docs/A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER.md | head -n 1
```

An exact a12-dmkits revision must resolve when its handback is reviewed. If later upstream history rewriting makes it unreachable, retain the historical citation, do not invent a replacement mapping, and re-discharge any reused claim against the maintained owner at the then-current reviewed revision. The [archived receipt-continuity record](archived/A12-DMKITS-SPEC-SYNC-LEDGER-THROUGH-2026-08-28.md#receipt-continuity) documents the established boundary and claim limit.

## Entry kinds and routing

- **`SPEC-…`** records a locally originated semantic correction that still needs a12-dmkits reconciliation. A locally measured static-legality finding is a `SPEC-`, not an experiment request.
- **`EXP-…`** requests one specific kernel-runtime observation only after the available local source, static-check, retained-evidence, and runtime-probe routes have been checked and shown unable to settle it. State the exact input, competing accounts, prediction under each account, negative result, and route limit. If no input distinguishes the accounts, the entry is not ready.
- A `dmtool-release` command, schema, diagnostic, exit, or artifact defect is instrument feedback rather than kernel semantics. A cross-project capability or retirement request follows the [upstream engagement rule](SEMANTIC-CAPSULE-PIPELINE-PROPOSAL.md#upstream-engagement-rule).

[`SOURCES.md`](SOURCES.md#engine-routing-rule--pick-the-layer-by-the-question-not-by-habit) owns the current observation-route inventory and [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md#the-kernel-runtime-probe-route) owns its method. Every claim leaving this repository must also satisfy the discharge rule in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#%EF%B8%8F-hard-rule--discharge-a-claim-before-stating-it-or-flag-it-and-surface-it).

## Current queue

No entries. There are no `pending` or `handed-off` reconciliation items as of the archive split on 2026-08-28.
